An error was returned by a Serde trait during (de)serialization tracing. In practice, this happens when
user-provided code 'impl<'de> Deserialize<'de> for Foo { .. }' rejects a candidate value of type `Foo`
provided by serde-reflection.

To fix this, add a call `tracer.trace_value(foo, &mut samples)` so that a correct value `foo` is
recorded *before* `tracer.trace_type` is called.

            NotSupported(_) => {
                r#"
An unsupported callback was called during (de)serialization tracing. In practice, this happens when an
unsupported Serde attribute is used. Attributes specific to self-describing formats (JSON, YAML, TOML)
are generally not supported. This includes: `#[serde(flatten)]`, `#[serde(tag = "type")]`,
`#[serde(tag = "t", content = "c")]`, and `#[serde(untagged)]`.

To fix this, avoid unsupported Serde attributes or use custom (de)serialize implementations with different
behaviors depending on the Serde callback `(De)Serializer::is_human_readable()`.

                r"
A value recorded by `trace_value` fails to deserialize as expected during a `trace_type` call. This can
happen if custom implementations of the Serialize and Deserialize traits do not agree.

Verify the implementations of Serialize and Deserialize for the given format.
".to_string()
            }

            Incompatible(_, _) => {
                r"
Two formats computed for the same entity do not match. This can happen if custom implementations of
the Serialize and Deserialize traits do not agree, e.g. if one uses `Vec<u8>` and the other one uses `&[u8]`
(implying bytes) --- see the crate `serde_bytes` for more context in this particular example.

Verify the implementations of Serialize and Deserialize for the given format.

            UnknownFormat => {
                r"
This internal error is returned should not be surfaced during tracing.
".to_string()

            UnknownFormatInContainer(name) => {
                format!(r"
A final registry was requested but some formats are still unknown within the container {name}. This can
happen if `tracer.trace_value` was called on a value `foo` which does not reveal some of the underlying
formats. E.g. if a field `x` of struct `Foo` has type `Option<String>` and `foo` is value of type
`Foo` such that `foo.x == None`, then tracing the value `foo` may result in a format `Option<Unknown>`
for the field `x`. The same applies to empty vectors and empty maps.

To fix this, avoid `trace_value` and prefer `trace_type` when possible, or make sure to trace at
least one value `foo` such that `foo.x` is not empty.

            MissingVariants(names) => {
                format!(r"
A registry was requested with `tracer.registry()` but some variants have not been analyzed yet
inside the given enums {names:?}.

To fix this, make sure to call `tracer.trace_type<T>(..)` at least once for each enum type `T` in the
corpus of definitions. You may also use `tracer.registry_unchecked()` for debugging.
