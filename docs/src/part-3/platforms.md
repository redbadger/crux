# Other platforms

This section is a collection of instructions for using Crux with other platforms
than the ones we've chosen to write Part I and Part II for. The support is
just as mature for all of them, we are simply more familiar with the four
we've shown in detail.

You can read about using Crux with:

- [Dioxus](./platforms/dioxus.md)
- [Remix](./platforms/remix.md)
- [Yew](./platforms/yew.md)
