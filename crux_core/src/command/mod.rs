//! Command represents one or more side-effects, resulting in interactions with the shell.
//!
//! Core creates Commands and returns them from the `update` function in response to events.
//! Commands can be created directly, but more often they will be created and returned
//! by capability APIs.
//!
//! A Command can execute side-effects in parallel, in sequence or a combination of both. To
//! allow this orchestration they provide both a simple synchronous API and access to an
//! asynchronous API.
//!
//! Command surfaces the effect requests and events sent in response with
//! the [`Command::effects`] and [`Command::events`] methods. These can be used when testing
//! the side effects requested by an `update` call.
//!
//! Internally, Command resembles [`FuturesUnordered`](futures::stream::FuturesUnordered):
//! it manages and polls a number of futures and provides a context which they can use
//! to submit effects to the shell and events back to the application.
//!
//! Command implements [`Stream`], making it useful in an async context,
//! enabling, for example, wrapping Commands in one another.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Commands are typically created by a capability and returned from the update function. Capabilities
//! normally return a builder, which can be used in both sync and async context. The basic sync use
//! is to bind the command to an Event which will be sent with the result of the command:
//!
//! ```
//!# use url::Url;
//!# use crux_core::{Command, render};
//!# use crux_http::command::Http;
//!# const API_URL: &str = "https://example.com/";
//!# pub enum Event { Increment, Set(crux_http::Result<crux_http::Response<usize>>) }
//!# #[derive(crux_core::macros::Effect)]
//!# pub struct Capabilities {
//!#     pub render: crux_core::render::Render<Event>,
//!#     pub http: crux_http::Http<Event>,
//!# }
//!# #[derive(Default)] pub struct Model { count: usize }
//!# #[derive(Default)] pub struct App;
//!# impl crux_core::App for App {
//!#     type Event = Event;
//!#     type Model = Model;
//!#     type ViewModel = ();
//!#     type Capabilities = Capabilities;
//!#     type Effect = Effect;
//! fn update(
//!     &self,
//!     event: Self::Event,
//!     model: &mut Self::Model,
//!     _caps: &Self::Capabilities)
//! -> Command<Effect, Event> {
//!     match event {
//!         //...
//!         Event::Increment => {
//!             let base = Url::parse(API_URL).unwrap();
//!             let url = base.join("/inc").unwrap();
//!
//!             Http::post(url)            // creates an HTTP RequestBuilder
//!                 .expect_json()
//!                 .build()               // creates a Command RequestBuilder
//!                 .then_send(Event::Set) // creates a Command
//!         }
//!         Event::Set(Ok(mut response)) => {
//!              let count = response.take_body().unwrap();
//!              model.count = count;
//!              render::render()
//!         }
//!         Event::Set(Err(_)) => todo!()
//!     }
//! }
//!# fn view(&self, model: &Self::Model) {
//!#     unimplemented!()
//!# }
//!# }
//! ```
//!
//! Commands can be chained, allowing the outputs of the first effect to be used in constructing the second
//! effect. For example, the following code creates a new post, then fetches the full created post based
//! on a url read from the response to the creation request:
//!
//! ```
//!# use crux_core::Command;
//!# use crux_http::command::Http;
//!# use crux_core::render::render;
//!# use doctest_support::command::{Effect, Event, AnOperation, AnOperationOutput, Post};
//!# const API_URL: &str = "https://example.com/";
//!# let result = {
//! let cmd: Command<Effect, Event> =
//!     Http::post(API_URL)
//!         .body(serde_json::json!({"title":"New Post", "body":"Hello!"}))
//!         .expect_json::<Post>()
//!         .build()
//!         .then_request(|result| {
//!             let post = result.unwrap();
//!             let url = &post.body().unwrap().url;
//!
//!             Http::get(url).expect_json().build()
//!         })
//!         .then_send(Event::GotPost);
//!
//! // Run the http request concurrently with notifying the shell to render
//! Command::all([cmd, render()])
//!# };
//! ```
//!
//! The same can be done with the async API, if you need more complex orchestration that is
//! more naturally expressed in async rust
//!
//! ```
//! # use crux_core::Command;
//! # use crux_http::command::Http;
//! # use doctest_support::command::{Effect, Event, AnOperation, AnOperationOutput, Post};
//! # const API_URL: &str = "";
//! let cmd: Command<Effect, Event> = Command::new(|ctx| async move {
//!     let first = Http::post(API_URL)
//!         .body(serde_json::json!({"title":"New Post", "body":"Hello!"}))
//!         .expect_json::<Post>()
//!         .build()
//!         .into_future(ctx.clone())
//!         .await;
//!
//!     let post = first.unwrap();
//!     let url = &post.body().unwrap().url;
//!
//!     let second = Http::get(url).expect_json().build().into_future(ctx.clone()).await;
//!
//!     ctx.send_event(Event::GotPost(second));
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! In the async context, you can spawn additional concurrent tasks, which can, for example,
//! communicate with each other via channels, to enable more complex orchestrations, stateful
//! connection handling and other advanced uses.
//!
//! ```
//! # use crux_core::Command;
//! # use doctest_support::command::{Effect, Event, AnOperation};
//! let mut cmd: Command<Effect, Event> = Command::new(|ctx| async move {
//!     let (tx, rx) = async_channel::unbounded();
//!
//!     ctx.spawn(|ctx| async move {
//!         for i in 0..10u8 {
//!             let output = ctx.request_from_shell(AnOperation::One(i)).await;
//!             tx.send(output).await.unwrap();
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     ctx.spawn(|ctx| async move {
//!         while let Ok(value) = rx.recv().await {
//!             ctx.send_event(Event::Completed(value));
//!         }
//!         ctx.send_event(Event::Aborted);
//!     });
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Commands can be cancelled, by calling [`Command::abort_handle`]
//! and then calling `abort` on the returned handle.
//!
//! ```
//! # use crux_core::Command;
//! # use doctest_support::command::{Effect, Event, AnOperation};
//! let mut cmd: Command<Effect, Event> = Command::all([
//!     Command::request_from_shell(AnOperation::One(1)).then_send(Event::Completed),
//!     Command::request_from_shell(AnOperation::Two(1)).then_send(Event::Completed),
//! ]);
//!
//! let handle = cmd.abort_handle();
//!
//! // Command is still running
//! assert!(!cmd.was_aborted());
//!
//! handle.abort();
//!
//! // Command is now finished
//! assert!(cmd.is_done());
//! // And was aborted
//! assert!(cmd.was_aborted());
//!
//! ```
//!
//! You can test that Commands yield the expected effects and events.
//! Commands can be tested in isolation by creating them explicitly
//! in a test, and then checking the effects and events they generated.
//! Or you can call your app's `update` function in a test, and perform
//! the same checks on the returned Command.
//!
//! ```
//! # use crux_http::{
//! #     command::Http,
//! #     protocol::{HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpResult},
