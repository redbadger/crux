//! Cross-platform app development in Rust
//!
//! Crux helps you share your app's business logic and behavior across mobile (iOS and Android) and web,
//! as a single, reusable core built with Rust.
//!
//! Unlike React Native, the user interface layer is built natively, with modern declarative UI frameworks
//! such as Swift UI, Jetpack Compose and React/Vue or a WASM based framework on the web.
//!
//! The UI layer is as thin as it can be, and all other work is done by the shared core.
//! The interface with the core has static type checking across languages.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! Crux applications are split into two parts: a Core written in Rust and a Shell written in the platform
//! native language (e.g. Swift or Kotlin). It is also possible to use Crux from Rust shells.
//! The Core architecture is based on [Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
//!
//! Quick glossary of terms to help you follow the example:
//!
//! * Core - the shared core written in Rust
//!
//! * Shell - the native side of the app on each platform handling UI and executing side effects
//!
//! * App - the main module of the core containing the application logic, especially model changes
//!   and side-effects triggered by events. An App can delegate to child apps, mapping Events and Effects.
//!
//! * Event - main input for the core, typically triggered by user interaction in the UI
//!
//! * Model - data structure (typically tree-like) holding the entire application state
//!
//! * View model - data structure describing the current state of the user interface
//!
//! * Effect - A side-effect the core can request from the shell. This is typically a form of I/O or similar
//!   interaction with the host platform. Updating the UI is considered an effect.
//!
//! * Command - A description of a side-effect or a sequence of side-effects to be executed by the shell.
//!   Commands can be combined (synchronously with combinators, or asynchronously with Rust async) to run
//!   sequentially or concurrently, or any combination thereof.
//!
//! * Capability - A user-friendly API used to create Commands for a specific effect type (e.g. HTTP)
//!
//!
//! Below is a minimal example of a Crux-based application Core:
//!
//! ```rust
//!// src/app.rs
//!use crux_core::{render::{self, RenderOperation}, App, macros::effect, Command};
//!use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//!// Model describing the application state
//!#[derive(Default)]
//!struct Model {
//!    count: isize,
//!}
//!
//!// Event describing the actions that can be taken
//!#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
//!pub enum Event {
//!    Increment,
//!    Decrement,
//!    Reset,
//!}
//!
//!// Effects the Core will request from the Shell
//!#[effect(typegen)]
//!pub enum Effect {
//!    Render(RenderOperation),
//!}
//!
//!#[derive(Default)]
//!struct Hello;
//!
//!impl App for Hello {
//!    // Use the above Event
//!    type Event = Event;
//!    // Use the above Model
//!    type Model = Model;
//!    type ViewModel = String;
//!    type Capabilities = (); // unused, see https://redbadger.github.io/crux/guide/effects.html
//!    // Use the above generated Effect
//!    type Effect = Effect;
//!
//!    fn update(&self, event: Event, model: &mut Model, _caps: &()) -> Command<Effect, Event> {
//!        match event {
//!            Event::Increment => model.count += 1,
//!            Event::Decrement => model.count -= 1,
//!            Event::Reset => model.count = 0,
//!        };
//!
//!        // Request a UI update
//!        render::render()
//!    }
//!
//!    fn view(&self, model: &Model) -> Self::ViewModel {
//!        format!("Count is: {}", model.count)
//!    }
//!}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Integrating with a Shell
//!
//! To use the application in a user interface shell, you need to expose the core interface for FFI.
//! This "plumbing" will likely be simplified with macros in the future versions of Crux.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // src/lib.rs
//! pub mod app;
//!
//! use lazy_static::lazy_static;
//! use wasm_bindgen::prelude::wasm_bindgen;
//!
//! pub use crux_core::bridge::{Bridge, Request};
//! pub use crux_core::Core;
//! pub use crux_http as http;
//!
//! pub use app::*;
//!
//! uniffi_macros::include_scaffolding!("hello");
//!
//! lazy_static! {
//!     static ref CORE: Bridge<Effect, App> = Bridge::new(Core::new::<Capabilities>());
//! }
//!
//! #[wasm_bindgen]
//! pub fn process_event(data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
//!     CORE.process_event(data)
//! }
//!
//! #[wasm_bindgen]
//! pub fn handle_response(id: u32, data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
//!     CORE.handle_response(id, data)
//! }
//!
//! #[wasm_bindgen]
//! pub fn view() -> Vec<u8> {
//!     CORE.view()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You will also need a `hello.udl` file describing the foreign function interface:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // src/hello.udl
//! namespace hello {
//!   sequence<u8> process_event([ByRef] sequence<u8> msg);
//!   sequence<u8> handle_response([ByRef] sequence<u8> res);
//!   sequence<u8> view();
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! Finally, you will need to set up the type generation for the `Model`, `Message` and `ViewModel` types.
//! See [typegen](https://docs.rs/crux_core/latest/crux_core/typegen/index.html) for details.
