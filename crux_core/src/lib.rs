//! Cross-platform app development in Rust
//!
//! Crux helps you share your app's business logic and behavior across mobile (iOS and Android) and web,
//! as a single, reusable core built with Rust.
//!
//! Unlike React Native, the user interface layer is built natively, with modern declarative UI frameworks
//! such as Swift UI, Jetpack Compose and React/Vue or a WASM based framework on the web.
//!
//! The UI layer is as thin as it can be, and all other work is done by the shared core.
//! The interface with the core has static type checking across languages.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! Crux applications are split into two parts: a Core written in Rust and a Shell written in the platform
//! native language (e.g. Swift or Kotlin).
//! The Core architecture is based on [Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
//!
//! Quick glossary of terms to help you follow the example:
//!
//! * Core - the shared core written in Rust
//!
//! * Shell - the native side of the app on each platform handling UI and executing side effects
//!
//! * App - the main module of the core containing the application logic, especially model changes
//!   and side-effects triggered by events. App can be composed from modules, each resembling a smaller, simpler app.
//!
//! * Event - main input for the core, typically triggered by user interaction in the UI
//!
//! * Model - data structure (typically tree-like) holding the entire application state
//!
//! * View model - data structure describing the current state of the user interface
//!
//! * Effect - A side-effect the core can request from the shell. This is typically a form of I/O or similar
//!   interaction with the host platform. Updating the UI is considered an effect.
//!
//! * Capability - A user-friendly API used to request effects and provide events that should be dispatched
//!   when the effect is completed. For example, a HTTP client is a capability.
//!
//! Below is a minimal example of a Crux-based application Core:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // src/app.rs
//!
//! use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//! use crux_core::{App, render::Render};
//!
//! // Model describing the application state
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct Model {
//!     count: isize,
//! }
//!
//! // Event describing the actions that can be taken
//! #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! enum Event {
//!     Increment,
//!     Decrement,
//!     Reset,
//! }
//!
//! // Capabilities listing the side effects the Core
//! // will use to request side effects from the Shell
//! #[derive(Effect)]
//! pub struct Capabilities {
//!     pub render: Render<Event>
//! }
//!
//! impl App for Hello {
//!     // Use the above Event
//!     type Event = Event;
//!     // Use the above Model
//!     type Model = Model;
//!     type ViewModel = String;
//!     // Use the above Capabilities
//!     type Capabilities = Capabilities;
//!
//!     fn update(&self, event: Event, model: &mut Model, caps: &Capabilities) {
//!         match event {
//!             Event::Increment => model.count += 1,
//!             Event::Decrement => model.count -= 1,
//!             Event::Reset => model.count = 0,
//!         };
//!
//!         // Request a UI update
//!         caps.render.render()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn view(&self, model: &Model) -> self::ViewModel {
//!         format!("Count is: {}", model.count)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Integrating with a Shell
//!
//! To use the application in a user interface shell, you need to expose the core interface for FFI.
//! This "plumbing" will likely be simplified with macros in the next version of Crux.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // src/lib.rs
//! pub mod app;
//!
//! use lazy_static::lazy_static;
//! use wasm_bindgen::prelude::wasm_bindgen;
//!
//! pub use crux_core::Request;
//! use crux_core::Core;
//!
//! pub use app::*;
//!
//! uniffi_macros::include_scaffolding!("hello");
//!
//! lazy_static! {
//!     static ref CORE: Core<Effect, App> = Core::new::<Capabilities>();
//! }
//!
//! #[wasm_bindgen]
//! pub fn process_event(data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
//!     CORE.process_event(data)
//! }
//!
//! #[wasm_bindgen]
//! pub fn handle_response(uuid: &[u8], data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
//!     CORE.handle_response(uuid, data)
//! }
//!
//! #[wasm_bindgen]
//! pub fn view() -> Vec<u8> {
//!     CORE.view()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You will also need a `hello.udl` file describing the foreign function interface:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // src/hello.udl
//! namespace hello {
//!   sequence<u8> process_event([ByRef] sequence<u8> msg);
//!   sequence<u8> handle_response([ByRef] sequence<u8> res);
//!   sequence<u8> view();
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! Finally, you will need to set up the type generation for the `Model`, `Message` and `ViewModel` types.
//! See [typegen] for details.
//!
