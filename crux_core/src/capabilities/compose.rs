//! ## DEPRECATED
//!
//! Capabilities are the legacy interface to side-effects, and this module will be removed in a future version
//! of crux. If you're starting a new app, you should use the [`command`](crate::command) API, specifically
//! [`CommandContext::spawn`](crate::command::CommandContext::spawn).
//!
//! A capability which can spawn tasks which orchestrate across other capabilities. This
//! is useful for orchestrating a number of different effects into a single transaction.

#[expect(deprecated)]

/// Compose capability can be used to orchestrate effects into a single transaction.
///
/// Example include:
/// * Running a number of HTTP requests in parallel and waiting for all to finish
/// * Chaining effects together, where the output of one is the input of the next and the intermediate
///   results are not useful to the app
/// * Implementing request timeouts by selecting across a HTTP effect and a time effect
/// * Any arbitrary graph of effects which depend on each other (or not).
///
/// The compose capability doesn't have any operations it emits to the shell, and type generation fails
/// on its operation type ([`Never`]). This is difficult for crux to detect
/// at the moment. To avoid this problem until a better fix is found, use `#[effect(skip)]` to skip the
/// generation of an effect variant for the compose capability. For example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use crux_core::macros::Effect;
/// # use crux_core::{compose::Compose, render::Render};
/// # enum Event { Nothing }
/// #[derive(Effect)]
/// pub struct Capabilities {
///     pub render: Render<Event>,
///     #[effect(skip)]
///     pub compose: Compose<Event>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that testing composed effects is more difficult, because it is not possible to enter the effect
/// transaction "in the middle" - only from the beginning - or to ignore some of the effects with out
/// stalling the entire downstream dependency chain.
