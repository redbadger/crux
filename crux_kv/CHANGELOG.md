## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.5.1...crux_kv-v0.5.2) - 2024-10-23

### Other

- tidy and docs udpate
- update http and kv tests to use new API

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.5.0...crux_kv-v0.5.1) - 2024-20-21

- Serialization of bytes can now be more efficient with [`serde_bytes`](https://github.com/serde-rs/bytes).
  see https://github.com/redbadger/crux/pull/273
- Fixes a problem building the crate for the `typegen` feature, see https://github.com/redbadger/crux/pull/277

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.4.2...crux_kv-v0.5.0) - 2024-08-13

It is no longer necessary to register types separately for this capability.
So you no longer need this in your `build.rs` file in the shared_types crate:

```rust
gen.register_type::<KeyValueResponse>()?;
gen.register_type::<KeyValueError>()?;
gen.register_type::<Value>()?;
```

### Other
- merge 0.8.1 to master

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.4.1...crux_kv-v0.4.2) - 2024-08-12

### Other
- updated the following local packages: crux_core

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.4.0...crux_kv-v0.4.1) - 2024-05-21

### Other

- Release crux_core v0.8.0
- registry now slab allocated with u32

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.3.0...crux_kv-v0.4.0) - 2024-05-17

### Breaking Changes

Introduces a `Value` enum, which can be `None` for a key that _doesn't_ exist,
or where there is no `previous_value`. See
https://github.com/redbadger/crux/pull/235.

### Other

- avoid clones of capability
- crux_kv take methods by move
- update API for crux_kv
- relax callback bounds in crux_kv

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.2.0...crux_kv-v0.3.0) - 2024-05-15

Hot on the heels of the last release, we've added a an
[operation to list keys](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/pull/232), and
[improved the app-facing API of crux_kv](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/pull/231).
The latter means that there is now a much more idiomatic Rust API for
interacting with the key-value store.

### Other

- KeyValueError::CursorNotFound, and doc comments to describe semantics
- list keys
- unwrap methods
- Simplify app-facing API of crux_kv

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/redbadger/crux/compare/crux_kv-v0.1.10...crux_kv-v0.2.0) - 2024-05-14

### Breaking Changes

This is a breaking change release. We've added `delete` and `exists` operations
and renamed `read` to `get` and `write` to `set`, amongst other renames and type
changes. We've also improved error handling and tests. See
https://github.com/redbadger/crux/pull/227 for more information. However, there
are sadly still no atomic or batch operations, which will follow in a future
release.

### Other

- deps
- Merge branch 'master' into relax-callback-bounds
- reduce nesting in kv output enums
- use enums instead of Result and Option for FFI types in crux_kv
- take owned values as cloning anyway
- move tests from integration to unit
- add exists, and update tests
- add delete to KeyValue, and move towards wasi-kv
